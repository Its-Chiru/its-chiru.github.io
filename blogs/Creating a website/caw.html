            <p>To create a simple website, like the one you are currently in is really easy</p>
            <p>You may be thinking that for web creation you need allot of knowledge in programming but it isnt like that, this website is entirely in html and css that are two really easy languages!</p>
            <h1>How to start?</h1>
            <p>As everything I started with videos and I recommend that too, but firstly is important that you have a good code editor that makes coding easier, the best option is Visual Studio Code.</p>
            <p>After that you can just make an empty .html file and start adding stuff as h1, and p the thing is as it is html is pretty ugly and thats why CSS comes to make everything great.</p>
            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>If you messed arrond with tutorials for a while and made some stuff, you can now start with css that will make everything prettier, the thing is sometime it gets confusing as its hard to make the code not a mess.</p>
            <p>CSS works as setting parameters to some items or classes etc... so all the code is like this:</p>
            <img src="examplecss.png">
            <p>This what it does is sets some parameters to the body(Where all the "web" is in the html), such as the background color, the color(Text color) it removes the padding and margin for all the elements because it comes with some. It also centers the texts and sets the size for the h1.</p>
            <p>If in the html you set a div with some class, you can edit it in the css as : ".classname{} then inside the brackets edit is as normal.</p>
            <h1>Modern Tools</h1>
            <p>Well, right now you can do lots of stuff, I really recomend getting ideas from videos or viewing some example proyects.</p>
            <p>As the title says, remember using tools isnt cheating and some are really helpfull to code.</p>
            <p>The one I recomend the most is ChatGPT, with good parameters when asking the question you can get great examples for things you need to make or creative ideas. The things you can do with ChatGPT are limitless and you will probably learn allot!</p>
            <h1>This website, and myself</h1>
            <p>This website is hosted at github(at the moment of writing this), what that means is that all the code for this website can be viewed, if you check it out you may learn (my code is kinda a mess lol)</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/Its-Chiru/its-chiru.github.io"><button>CHECK IT OUT!</button></a>
            <p>Personally I started messing around with HTML, and then I started watching some tutorials and discovered you can do some really cool stuff, then learned css really quickly too as is soo easy.</p>
            <p>I think is really possible to learn web development and doo cool stuff in less that a week!</p>
