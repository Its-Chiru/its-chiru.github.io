            <p>Ok, so you wonder how I created my blogs, or how to add your blog on to my website?</p>
            <p>Well, I created the blogs in my website, mostly as some tutorials for people or for myself, and because I want to have some text I could keep here on my web!</p>
            <h1>How did I create it?</h1>
            <p>Well, it wasnt easy, but it wasnt that hard. At the moment its all html and css and its pretty simple, the hard part was the grid for all the blogs, but I ended up resolving it.</p>
            <p>To be more precise what I did for making multiple blogs easier to make, is make one .css as a template that will work with all the .html blogs I do so I can just add some simple html and will make it look good.</p>
            <h1>Will there be blogs from other people?</h1>
            <p>Its hard to know right know, first I dont think somebody would want to put some blog on my lame website, but if someone wants I would have to see whats the blog about and decide myself if I will add it.</p>
            <p>If you would like just contact me in the contact tab.</p>
